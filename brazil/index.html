    <h2>ABOUT BRAZIL</h2>
    <p>Brazil is the largest country in South America and the fifth largest nation in the world. It forms an enormous
        triangle on the eastern side of the continent with a 7,400km coastline along the Atlantic Ocean. It has borders
        with every South American country except Chile and Ecuador. The Brazilian landscape is very varied. It is most
        well known for its dense forests, including the Amazon, the world’s largest rainforest, in the north. But there
        are also dry grasslands (called pampas), rugged hills, pine forests, sprawling wetlands, immense plateaus (areas
        of level high ground) and a long coastal plain. Now it is the country’s industrial capital,
        home to Brazil’s biggest cities: São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. It covers only 11 percent of the country but 43
        percent of the country’s population lives there.</p>

    <h2>BRAZIL PEOPLE AND CULTURE</h2>
    <p>
        Most Brazilians are descended from three ethnic groups: Amerindians, European settlers (mainly from Portugal)
        and Africans. Starting in the 19th century, waves of immigrants from Europe, the Middle East, and even Japan
        added to this mix. This diversity of people has created a rich religious, musical and culinary culture. The
        Brazilian culture is one of the world’s most varied and diverse. This is due to its being a melting pot of
        nationalities, as a result of centuries of European domination as well as slavery, which brought hordes of
        African migrants across Brazil’s borders to live in and influence the local cultures with their ancient customs
        and ideas.
